Project Roadmap
Pathfinding in a Grid-Based World
Phase 1 — Foundation (Completed)

✔ Create project structure
✔ Implement terrain system
✔ Load and validate JSON world maps
✔ Convert terrain shortcodes → long names
✔ Basic ASCII render system

Phase 2 — Pathfinding Engine (Completed)

✔ Implement PathGlyph
✔ Implement A* from scratch
✔ Add movement cost modes:

fewest_steps

lowest_energy

✔ Neighbour validation (bounds + walls)
✔ Reconstruct path logic

Phase 3 — Testing (Completed)

✔ Write 13 pytest tests
✔ Fix edge cases
✔ Achieve 100% pass rate
✔ Debug Map_Anvil neighbours and traversability

Phase 4 — Web Backend (Completed)

✔ Build Flask API
✔ /upload_map endpoint
✔ /pathfind endpoint
✔ Return:

ASCII render

path list

total movement cost

✔ Auto-reload dev server

Phase 5 — Web UI (Completed)

✔ index.html layout
✔ app.js logic
✔ default world autoload
✔ coloured grid renderer
✔ terrain legend
✔ start/goal selection interface

Phase 6 — Polishing (Current)

⬜ Add animations
⬜ Add nicer interface styling
⬜ Add multiple theme options
⬜ Add random world generator (optional)
⬜ Add path length / energy charts (optional)

Phase 7 — Submission Prep (Next)

⬜ Final cleanup
⬜ Remove __pycache__
⬜ Ensure README.md is perfect
⬜ Zip final project
⬜ Submit on Moodle

Optional Future Work

3D terrain height-based cost

Fog of war (partial vision)

Dijkstra mode

BFS mode

Mobile-friendly UI
