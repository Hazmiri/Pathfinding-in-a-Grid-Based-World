Pathfinding in a Grid-Based World

This project implements an advanced pathfinding system based on the A* algorithm within a fully custom grid-based fantasy world. 
The environment contains varied terrain types, each with distinct movement costs, alongside impassable regions that shape the search space. 
The project features a complete Python implementation, automated testing suite, and a fully interactive web interface for visualisation.
Designed with clarity, correctness and academic rigour in mind, the system demonstrates how classical pathfinding algorithms can be adapted to handle weighted topologies and diagonal movement while maintaining optimality.
The work forms part of a broader investigation into algorithm selection, efficiency, and ethical considerations in autonomous navigation.
